    "- In the Joint Urban 2003 field study, SF6 tracer gas was released during the 10 Intensive Observation Periods(IOPs). \n",
    "- Each IOP included two or three continuous 30-min releases and 3-6 instantaneous puff releases.\n",
    "- For the field study as a whole there were 29 continuous releases (17 daytime and 12 nocturnal) and 40 puff releases (25 daytime and 15 nocturnal). \n",
    "- All of the releases were from the built up downtown urban area.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As this project deals with the real-time sensor readings prediction, the 29 continuous releases are the area of the interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "> But the given data has the puff releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also took real time, fast-response tracer measurements using 10 TGAs mounted in vans, all but one at a fixed location for the duration of any given release period. \n",
    "- One TGA was driven back and forth continuously to obtain a cross-section of the plume.\n",
    "- Additional fast-response sampling was done using Miran samplers in proximity to the release.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The 10 TGA's tracer measurements are the fast-response, which are equivalent to sensors. Hence, these readings are used to build the model\n"

    "- If the medians appeared to make a tight group at the appropriate location, it was assumed that the GPS worked reasonably well and the reported position was the average of these medians.  \n",

There are also a few instances where the GPS lost its position and took several minutes to regain it.  \n",
